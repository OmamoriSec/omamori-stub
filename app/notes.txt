All communication in the DNS protocol are carried in the single format called a "message". Each message consists of 5
sections: header, question, answer, authority, and an additional space

Header section structure

Packet Identifier (ID)	16 bits	A random ID assigned to query packets. Response packets must reply with the same ID.

Query/Response Indicator (QR)	1 bit	1 for a reply packet, 0 for a question packet.

Operation Code (OPCODE)	4 bits	Specifies the kind of query in a message.

Authoritative Answer (AA)	1 bit	1 if the responding server "owns" the domain queried, i.e., it's authoritative.

Truncation (TC)	1 bit	1 if the message is larger than 512 bytes. Always 0 in UDP responses.

Recursion Desired (RD)	1 bit	Sender sets this to 1 if the server should recursively resolve this query, 0 otherwise.

Recursion Available (RA)	1 bit	Server sets this to 1 to indicate that recursion is available.

Reserved (Z)	3 bits	Used by DNSSEC queries. At inception, it was reserved for future use.

Response Code (RCODE)	4 bits	Response code indicating the status of the response.

Question Count (QDCOUNT)	16 bits	Number of questions in the Question section.

Answer Record Count (ANCOUNT)	16 bits	Number of records in the Answer section.

Authority Record Count (NSCOUNT)	16 bits	Number of records in the Authority section.

Additional Record Count (ARCOUNT)	16 bits	Number of records in the Additional section.
